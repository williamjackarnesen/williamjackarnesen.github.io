<p>My name is William Jack Arnesen. I am a policy manager at the Market Shaping Accelerator at the University of Chicago (2023-). I hold a Bachelor's degree from Yale University in Economics & Mathematics (2020). I previously worked  on markets at Kalshi (2021-2023), and as a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2020-21). I will be starting a Ph.D. in Business Economics at Harvard University beginning in fall 2025</p>

<p>I am principally interested in the economics of innovation and industrial organization. My research at the University of Chicago has focused on estimating the appropriate size of <a href="https://williamjackarnesen.github.io/msa-amc-sizing/">advance market commitments for novel innovations in public goods.</p>
