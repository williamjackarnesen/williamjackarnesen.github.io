<h1> The challenges of selectively breeding for low-methane cattle </h1>
<body>
<div class="embed-container">

<h2>Brief introduction</h2>

<ol>
  <li> <p> <strong>Cattle are emissions-intensive:</strong>
    Roughly 5% of <span class="tooltip">global emissions
      <span class="tooltiptext">"Global emissions", as measured by the ability to warm the climate over a 100-year period. Using this metric, one ton of methane is equivalent to about 28 tons of carbon dioxide. </span>
    </span> come from ruminant animals, especially cattle. Each head of cattle emits around 150-250 pounds of methane per year which, using the Biden EPA's social cost of methane, is worth around $120-200 in social damage annually. 
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p> <strong>Selective breeding represents one potential tool to reduce this social cost: </strong> Cattle have two sources of natural heterogeneity in their natural production of methane, caused by both 
    <span class="tooltip">productivity differences
      <span class="tooltiptext">Larger cows consume more feed and produce more methane, but are also more productive</span>
    </span> and <span class="tooltip"> idiosyncratic factors.
      <span class="tooltiptext">We call this component of methane production "residual methane"</span>
    </span>
    To date, selective breeding for productivity has dramatically cut the emissions-intensivity of the cattle industry. By improving <span class="tooltip">herd health
      <span class="tooltiptext">Sick cows produce methane without corresponding economic benefits, so a healthier cow is more methane-efficient per unit of milk/beef</span> 
    </span> and shortening the period from birth to economic production, emissions per kilogram of milk     <span class="tooltip">declined 55%
      <span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751731117002592">Broderick 2018</a></span> 
    </span> between 1924 and 2014. Ranchers will continue to selectively breed for productivity, but accelerating the pace of methane reduction might require reducing methane even if doing so trades off with productivity. 
  </p>
</li>


<li><strong>Incorporating methane into selective breeding is relatively straightforward:</strong> Ranchers would need to assemble a "reference herd" of around 4,000 bulls. The breeder would then genotype and phenotype each of these bulls and measure their methane production. Afterwards, they would create a predictive model that maps bull semen to predicted methane emissions. A funder would then attach a subsidy value per unit of predicted methane production below some baseline. Ranchers would be paid for each low-methane cow they include in their herd, with the size of the subsidy proportional to the degree of the methane reduction.  With a financial incentive to care about methane, ranchers would begin by swapping out high-merit for slightly-lower-merit bulls whose lower methane production warrants a large enough subsidy to justify the swap.

  <div>
    <p>Some formal details. Assume we have a herd of $n$ bulls. Each bull possesses two traits: $merit$ and $methane$. Currently, the rancher will select the top $k\%$ by merit, where $k$ is some low value such as 1%. In other words, the selection index $I$ is equal to </p>

    <p>$$\text{Index}_{\text{old}} = \text{merit}$$</p>

    <p>$$ \mathbb{P} (\text{Index}_{\text{old}} > \text{threshold}_{\text{old}}) = k $$</p>

    <p>Now we add a subsidy per unit of methane so that </p>

    <p>$$\text{Index}_{\text{new}} = \text{merit} + \text{subsidy} $$</p>

    <p>\[
\text{subsidy} =
\begin{cases}
-\lambda \cdot \text{methane}, & \text{if } \text{methane} < \text{threshold}_{\text{methane}}, \\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]
</p>

<p>where $\lambda$ is some weight that the planner sets, $\text{threshold}_{\text{methane}}$ is the maximum methane production eligible for subsidy (set by the planner), $\text{threshold}_{\text{new}}$ is the index threshold for selection, and $ \mathbb{P} (\text{Index}_{\text{new}} > \text{threshold}_{\text{new}}) = k $</p>

<p> Visually, we can represent the two selection rules below. All bulls to the right of the respective dashed lines would be selected. The larger the weight on methane ($\lambda$), the more horizontal the dashed blue line becomes. The blue line eventually becomes vertical because high-emitting bulls receive no payment, not negative payments.

<h2> Three large problems with cost-effectiveness </h2> 

<ol>
  <li> <p><strong>Trade-off with productivity: </strong> Even if one chooses to select on the basis of <span class="tooltip">residual methane
      <span class="tooltiptext">The component of methane variation uncorrelated with productivity</span> 
    </span>, the new herd will still be lower-merit than a herd that does not care at all about methane. By analogy, a basketball GM who cares only about height will select a taller team than a basketball GM who cares about both height and shooting ability, even if height and shooting are uncorrelated. Less colloquially, every additional factor one adds to the "breeding objective" reduces the extent to which one can optimize for other traits. Moreover, the variation in residual methane is so small compared to the variation in <span class="tooltip">merit<span class="tooltiptext">A.k.a. economic productivity</span> 
    </span> that only a heavy weighting on methane can induce a major change in rancher behavior. Meanwhile, If one instead selects on the basis of total methane production, one needs to compensate ranchers even further, as lower-methane cattle become, on average, lower in merit as well. </p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Payments cannot become negative:</strong> Unlike a carbon tax, this subsidy scheme would entirely be voluntary. The scheme organizers cannot collect payments from ranchers using particularly high-methane cattle, and can only offer subsidies to ranchers using low-methane cattle. This restriction both limits the effectiveness of the program (since average cattle and high-methane cattle are treated identically), but also explodes the total cost (since receipts cannot offset any of the net payments). </p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Large problems with additionality:</strong> <span class="tooltip">Additionality<span class="tooltiptext">"Additionality" is often called "infra-marginality" in other contexts</span> 
    </span> refers to the problem in environmental economics of assessing which changes are directly caused by a program. Payments for low-methane activities that would have occurred in the absence of any subsidy program are "non-additional", and thus wasted. This non-additionality problem is highly acute. By random chance, a rancher with 1000 cows will have around 500 cows with above-average methane production and around 500 cows with below-average methane production. Under the scheme described above, this rancher--who has made no effort to reduce their emissions--could receive payments for those 500 low-methane cows. The program would still have some effect--the rancher has an incentive to marginally reduce their emissions--but the payments would become wildly disproportionate to the actual benefits offered. This problem is severe: in my analysis of Holstein bulls, a hypothetical weight of $160/ton of methane (10% of the social cost) would result in 90% of subsidy dollars going to bulls that would have been selected regardless of the incentive program. Even that number understates the harm, as it does not count extra dollars given to bulls who would have been selected even with a smaller subsidy. </p></li>

</ol>
Collectively, these problems create an inescapable trade-off. If one uses a small per-ton subsidy, the overwhelming majority of payments will be non-additional. If one uses a large per-ton subsidy, the non-additional share will fall but at great expense that more than offsets. The below charts estimate use real data on the merit distribution for Holstein dairy cows in the US and in Scandinavia, with a ton of reduced methane priced at $1600/ton. Even assuming zero fixed costs (so monitoring, administration, or set-up costs), the benefits per cows are low and the benefit-cost ratio suggests this intervention is not promising. 

<p></p>

  Below is a brief description of the real-life modeling for residual methane.
  <ol>
    <li>First, take the distribution of merit from the <a href="https://webconnect.uscdcb.com/#/top-animal-listing">Council on Dairy Cattle Breeding</a> and <a href="https://nordic.mloy.fi/navbull?breed=HOL&country=AllCountries&herdbookCountry=DNK&-progenyTest=WithDFS&orderBy=NTM&desc&pageSize=14626 ">Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation</a> for the month of December 2024.</li>
    <li>For each bull in the real data, randomly generate an associated residual methane value, assuming a normal distribution and a standard deviation of 50.8 g/day of residual methane by following <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002203022100597X">Manzanilla-Pech et al. 2021</a></li>
    <li>Assume a subsidy on methane equivalent to 5%, 10%, 15%, of the social cost of methane. Assume a selection intensity of 1% (so only the top 1% of bulls are selected). Assign a potential subsidy to each bull equal to the weight on methane times the level of residual methane reduction below zero. Compare the herd selected using the old rule (merit only) with the herd selected using the new rule (merit plus subsidy). The difference in expected methane is the social gain, while the social cost is the total subsidy. Subsidies given to bulls that are selected under both rules are considered infra-marginal (this measure undercounts true inframarginality, as it excludes extra payments made to bulls who could have been selected with a smaller positive payment)</li>
    <li>Repeat steps two and three 100 times for each weight on methane. The values reported below are the average of the 100 simulations.</li>
  </ol>

  In a later section, we examine total methane production, using simulated herds. In this case, we assume a herd of 10,000 bulls, a mean merit of &#36;10,000, a standard deviation of merit of &#36;71.93, a mean methane production of 5,000 kg/bull (CO2-equivalent) and a standard deviation of methane production of 290.47 kg. We then vary both the weight on methane in the selection index and the extent to which merit and methane production positively correlate.

<h2>The interesting intersection between antagonistic correlation and reduced costs</h2>

Instead of selecting for residual methane, could a funder instead target total methane production? Recall that total methane production positively correlates with economic productivity, so lower-methane cows are, on average, possess lower merit. One large advantage of including total methane is that the natural variation increases dramatically, so reductions of over 25% remains possible (whereas residual methane limits the upside to around 1%). Increasing the level of correlation between methane production and economic productivity has two countervailing effects:
<ol>
  <li>Increasing the level of correlation <strong>increases</strong> costs, as the subsidy scheme needs to compensate ranchers for the greater loss of merit from selecting low-methane cows</li>
  <li>Increasing the level of correlation <strong>lowers</strong> costs, as the loss of cows that are both low-methane and high-merit means payments become inframarginal/non-additional</li>
</ol>

<p>
Surprisingly, <strong>the second effect (improved targeting) always dominates the first effect (greater trade-off with merit)</strong>. As a result, increasing the level of antagonistic correlation <span class="tooltip">always<span class="tooltiptext">Some trivial exceptions exist: one could imagine an entirely bimodal distribution where the effects would be identical, as both schemes result in no effect </span> </span> improves the benefit-cost ratio of the intervention. This finding holds even with radically different distributions: normal or non-normal, different variations, etc. Why this effect always holds true remains uncertain. The upshot is that, ironically, more costly interventions can be more cost-effective if they result in superior targeting.

  </div>

Cattle breeding is not the only instance of this trade-off. Many climate domains include green activities that are profitable and would occur regardless of the existence of any subsidy scheme. Some examples:

<ol>
  <li><strong><span class="tooltip">Conservation auctions
      <span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://annarusso.github.io/papers/aspelund_russo_crp.pdf">Aspelund & Russo 2025</a></span> </strong> where landowners volunteer to conserve their land (in exchange for subsidy payments). Unsurprisingly, the first ranchers willing to offer up their land are those who were not planning to use their land anyways. The best ideas on how to reduce this problem are to have the auctioneer try to predict which uses are additional or not, which is tricky at best</li>
  <li><strong>Industrial decarbonization:</strong> Many possible pathways exist to reduce the enormous emissions of the cement industry. Some of these methods are relatively cheap, and will likely occur regardless (such as blending in supplemental cementitious materials, or enhancing energy efficiency) whenever a new plant is built. In general, we should want economic agents to pursue the cheapest means of achieving the end -- anything less is wasteful. But if the planner lacks an ability to determine whether the cheapest means are actually additional, preferring subsidizing the next-cheapest method may be justifiable. </li>
</ol>  

<h2>An alternative approach to slightly improve numbers</h2>

<p>Instead of paying on a per-cow basis, a planner could instead pay on a per-rancher basis. In this case, the planner requests the data from the entire herd used and compares the predicted emissions of the entire herd to a baseline. Suppose a rancher had 520 low-methane cows and 480 (symmetrically) high-methane cows, so that their emissions were truly exactly average. Under the old scheme, they could receive subsidy payments for each of those 520 low-methane cows. Under the new regime, they would only get paid on the difference from the baseline, equivalent to about 40 cows. In such a scenario, a rancher with a random distribution of cows would receive no payments. </p>

<p></p>
Two logistical challenges would need to be worked out for this solution to work:

<ol>
  <li>One would need an extensive monitoring system to make sure ranchers are not hiding their high-methane cows. These monitoring costs could eliminate the cost advantage</li>
  <li>One would need to avoid a scenario where ranchers substitute a small number of large, high-methane cows for a larger number of smaller, low-methane cows. Any scheme that rewards total methane production has this weakness. Targeting residual methane, however, runs into the low-variance challenge where cost-efficincy is achieved at the expense of low total gains.</li>
